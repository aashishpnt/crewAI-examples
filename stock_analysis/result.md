After reviewing the financial data for NDSN and PH, it is clear that both companies have shown positive revenue growth and operational improvements. NDSN has demonstrated consistent revenue increases over the years, with a slight decrease in organic sales, whereas PH has experienced significant growth in total revenues and steady improvement in net sales and gross profit margins. 

Based on this analysis, I would recommend investing in both NDSN and PH for long-term growth potential. NDSN's established revenue growth trajectory and PH's strong financial performance indicate promising opportunities for investors. Additionally, considering the lack of specific financial data for RSG and WBA, focusing on NDSN and PH would be the prudent choice for maximizing returns.

Furthermore, it is essential to monitor insider trading activities and upcoming events such as earnings releases to make informed investment decisions. By keeping a close eye on these factors, we can adjust our investment strategy accordingly to capitalize on market trends and company performance.

In conclusion, I recommend a balanced investment portfolio that includes NDSN and PH to leverage their growth potential and capitalize on their positive financial outlook. This diversified approach will help mitigate risks and optimize returns for our customer.
